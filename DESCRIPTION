Description: Unmatched regression refers to the regression setting where
    covariates and predictors are collected separately/independently and so are not paired
    together, as in the usual regression setting.   Balabdaoui, Doss, and Durot (2020) <arXiv:2007.00830>
    study the unmatched regression setting where the univariate regression function is known to
    be monotone.     This package implements (two) gradient    descent method(s) to
    compute the estimator developed in  Balabdaoui, Doss, and Durot (2020).
