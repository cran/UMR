Description: Unmatched regression refers to the regression setting where
    covariates and predictors are collected separately/independently and so are not paired     together, as in the usual regression setting.   Balabdaoui, Doss, and Durot (2021) <arXiv:2007.00830>    study the unmatched regression setting where the univariate regression function is known to    be monotone.     This package implements methods for computing  the estimator developed in  Balabdaoui, Doss, and Durot (2021).  The main method is an active-set-trust-region-based method.
